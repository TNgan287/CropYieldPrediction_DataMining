# CropYieldPrediction_DataMining
Collect data from Kaggle, apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to: <br> 
- Clean data <br>
- Preprocessing <br>
- Build machine learning models (Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Bagging Classifier) to recommend a crop based on crop features <br>
- Analyze and compare modelsâ€™ performance. <br>
